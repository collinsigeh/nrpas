            <hr>
            <h5>What is the difference between registering a RPA flown for fun vs. RPA flown for work or business?</h5>
            <p>
                If you fly your RPA for hobby or recreational purposes and you use the web-based registration process to register your aircraft, you only need to register once and then apply your registration number to as many RPA as you want. Recreational registrants only need to provide their name, address, and email address. Unmanned aircraft flown for work or business must be registered individually by the owner.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Do I always have to have my Certificate of Aircraft Registration with me while flying my RPA?</h5>
            <p>
                Yes. You must have the NCAA registration certificate in your possession when operating an unmanned aircraft. The certificate can be available either on paper or electronically.
            </p>
            <p>
                If another person operates your RPA, they must have the RPA registration certificate in their possession. You can give them a paper copy or email a copy to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Federal law requires RPA operators to show the certificate of registration to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer if asked. You can show it electronically or show the printed certificate.

            <h5>If I'm just flying my RPA inside a building, or in my own yard, do I have to register it?</h5>
            <p>
                Valid Email address If you're flying indoors, you do not need to register your unmanned aircraft as the NCAA does not regulate indoor RPA use. However, when flying in your own yard or over your own property, you will need to register your RPA if the RPA weighs more than 0.55 pounds.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>If my RPA weighs more than 55 lbs., what are the registration requirements?</h5>
            <p>
                Fly at or below 400 feet It must be registered using the NCAA's paper-based registration process.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                I'm a foreign national and want to fly my RPA in Nigeria on vacation. Do I have to register before flying?</h5>
            <p>
                If you are a foreign national and you are not eligible to register your RPA in the Nigeria there are two ways for you to operate. If you want to operate your RPA exclusively as model aircraft you must complete the steps in the web-based registration process and obtain a "recognition of ownership." This recognition of ownership is required by NCAA to operate a model aircraft in Nigeria. Alternatively, if you want to operate your RPA as a non-model aircraft you must register your RPA in the country in which you are eligible to register and obtain operating authority from the CAA.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>If my RPA is destroyed or is sold, lost, or transferred, do I need to do anything?</h5>
            <p>
                Less than 55 lbs. You should cancel your registration through the NCAA's online registration system.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>How do I mark my unmanned aircraft with my unique registration number?</h5>
            <p>
                If you complete registration using the web-based registration process and satisfy the registration requirements, you may use a permanent marker, label, or engraving, as long as the number remains affixed to the aircraft during routine handling and all operating conditions and is readily accessible and legible upon close visual inspection. The number may also be enclosed in a compartment that is readily accessible, such as a battery compartment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Requirements for marking unmanned aircraft registered in accordance with the legacy registration system can be found in Nig.CAR Part 4, section 4.1.1.1 . Guidance material on aircraft marking requirements in Part 4 can be found in Advisory Circular No. NCAA- GAD-AC-02 Identification and Registration Marking.

            <h5>When I provide my registration information, is it publicly available?</h5>
            <p>
                The web-based RPA registration database is not searchable at this time. The NCAA and the NCAA contractor who maintain the website and database will be able to see the data that you enter. Like the NCAA, the contractor is required to comply with strict legal requirements to protect the confidentiality of the personal data you provide. Under certain circumstances, law enforcement officers might also be able to see the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                As described in the applicable Privacy Act System of Records Notice for aircraft registration information, the public may search for aircraft information in the legacy, paper-based aircraft registration system by the aircraft registration number, aircraft owner name, and aircraft owner state/county or territory/county.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>I don't have access to a computer to register. Is there a form?</h5>
            <p>
                There are two registration systems available to RPA owners â€“ the web-based system designed exclusively for unmanned aircraft and the legacy paper-based registration system. If you don't have access to a computer to register, you may use the paper registration process.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Can I transfer my model registration to non-model registration?</h5>
            <p>
                Only the web-based registration system distinguishes model RPA registration requirements from non-model RPA registration requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time, the web-based registration system does not permit this type of transfer. You must complete registration as a non-modeler and provide specific aircraft information such as manufacturer name, model number and serial number, if applicable.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Is there a penalty for failing to register?</h5>
            <p>
                Failure to register an unmanned aircraft may result in regulatory and criminal penalties. The NCAA may assess civil penalties. Criminal penalties and/or imprisonment for up to three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no one-size-fits-all enforcement action for violations. All aspects of a violation will be considered, along with mitigating and aggravating circumstances surrounding the violation. In general, the NCAA will attempt to educate operators who fail to comply with registration requirements. However, fines will remain an option when egregious circumstances are present.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Who do I contact with registration questions or problems?</h5>
